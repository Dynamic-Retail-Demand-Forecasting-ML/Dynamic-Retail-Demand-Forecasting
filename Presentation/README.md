# How to Setup Your Presentation

1.  **Open your PowerPoint file** (`Dynamic-Retail-Demand-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning.pptx`).
2.  **Export Slides as Images**:
    *   Go to `File` > `Save As` (or `Export`).
    *   Choose `JPEG` or `PNG` as the file format.
    *   Select "All Slides" when prompted.
    *   This will create a folder containing all your slides as images.
3.  **Rename and Move Images**:
    *   Rename your slide images to `slide1.jpg`, `slide2.jpg`, `slide3.jpg`, etc.
    *   Move these images into the `Presentation/images` folder.
4.  **Update HTML (if needed)**:
    *   If you have more or fewer than 5 slides, open `Presentation/index.html`.
    *   Add or remove `<img src="images/slideX.jpg" ...>` lines in the `slides-container` div to match your number of slides.

## Usage
*   Open `Presentation/index.html` in your browser.
*   Click "Start Presentation" to go full screen.
*   Use **Right Arrow** to go next.
*   Use **Left Arrow** to go back.
